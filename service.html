                                    advancement of technology has, however, created a paradox: Every skill is rendered
                                    out-of-date within a short time. Unless a successful performer keeps in constant
                                    touch with changing methodologies, his competence even at the present job stands to
                                    be eroded. To cater to this ever changing demand for skills Infinium Associates has
